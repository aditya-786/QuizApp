Hello everyone...

We have made this app using python 3.x. To open and run this app, you can do two things...

1. Just copy and paste the code in IDLE or

2. Just install Jupyter and paste all the files in the directory where all the files of the jupyter will be going to save.

Thanks & Enjoy
